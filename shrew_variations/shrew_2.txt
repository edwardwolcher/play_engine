PETRUCHIO: Good morrow, Kate; for that's your name, I hear.
KATHARINA: (Singing) It is, and I cannot change it. <variation>
PETRUCHIO: You lie, in faith; for you are call'd plain Kate, And bonny Kate and sometimes Kate the curst; But Kate, the prettiest Kate in Christendom, Kate of Kate Hall, my super-dainty Kate, For dainties are all Kates, and therefore, Kate, Take this of me, Kate of my consolation; Hearing thy mildness praised in every town, Thy virtues spoke of, and thy beauty sounded, Yet not so deeply as to thee belongs, Myself am moved to woo thee for my wife.
KATHARINA: Moved! in good time: let him that moved you hither. Remove you hence: I knew you at the first, You were a moveable.
PETRUCHIO: Fair Kate! <variation>
KATHARINA: It is a wheel, I think, 'twixt wheel and wheel, To make a heavy cart go. <variation>
PETRUCHIO: Well, moveables are wainscot too. <variation>
KATHARINA: Ay, my father says what furniture's that? <variation>
PETRUCHIO: Furniture! why, the gods are furniture; the heavens Are deck'd with glistering furniture. <variation>
KATHARINA: Ay, and the earth, too, is a kind of – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – <variation>
PETRUCHIO: Alas! good Kate, I will not burden thee; For, knowing thee to be but young and light--
KATHARINA: Too light for such a swain as you to catch; And yet as heavy as my weight should be.
PETRUCHIO: And if thou wert light as air, my soul should be Able to raise light Kate from off the ground. <variation>
KATHARINA: Light, ye prevaricating son of Venice! Tell me, what is my name? <variation>
PETRUCHIO: Katharine. <variation>
KATHARINA: Ay, for a turtle, as he takes a buzzard.
PETRUCHIO: Come, come, you wasp; i' faith, you are too angry.
KATHARINA: By this light, were I a man, th— <variation>
PETRUCHIO: Well, Kate, I will not come to your waspishness. <variation>
KATHARINA: Waspishness? I pray you, tell me what is it? <variation>
PETRUCHIO: Marry, it is a waspish humour, Kate, that you will be angry with me, and I know not with what reason. <variation>
KATHARINA: Tell me, in the love of Christ, is my name Katharine or no? <variation>
PETRUCHIO: Zounds, Kate, I'll have a bout with you, or I go. <variation>
KATHARINA: I will tell thee what, husband, thou shalt go with me to see my aunt Katherina, or I will go with thee to see thy aunt Petruchio. <variation>
PETRUCHIO: What, with my tongue in your tail? nay, come again, Good Kate; I am a gentleman.
KATHARINA: What, like my father's pig? for indeed thou art an honest one. <variation>
[She strikes him]
PETRUCHIO: I swear I'll cuff you, if you strike again.
KATHARINA: So may you lose your arms. If you strike me, you are no gentleman; And if no gentleman, why then no arms.
PETRUCHIO: Good, Kate; but yet you lie. <variation>
KATHARINA: Ay, if I do, you have my consent to cuff me. <variation>
PETRUCHIO: A combless cock, so Kate will be my hen.
KATHARINA: And, Petruchio, I'll be thy cock my lord. <variation>
PETRUCHIO: Come, Kate, we two must go together. <variation>
KATHARINA: It is my fashion, when I see a crab.
PETRUCHIO: And is it come to this? Why, Kate, I say, My wife shall be as merry as I. <variation>
KATHARINA: Well, then, I hope you will not be so sour. <variation>
PETRUCHIO: Then show it me.
KATHARINA: Well, here it is. <variation>
PETRUCHIO: Why, this is a horse-collar. <variation>
KATHARINA: No, your beard. <variation>
PETRUCHIO: Tell me in sober sadness, if thy husband be a jolly fellow. <variation>
KATHARINA: So jolly a fellow, that he is scarce ever sober. <variation>
PETRUCHIO: 'Tis with cares.
KATHARINA: I care not.
PETRUCHIO: Nay, hear you, Kate: in sooth you scape not so.
KATHARINA: Have you any beard? <variation>
PETRUCHIO: No, not a whit: I find you passing gentle. 'Twas told me you were rough and coy and sullen, And now I find report a very liar;For thou are pleasant, gamesome, passing courteous, But slow in speech, yet sweet as spring-time flowers: Thou canst not frown, thou canst not look askance, Nor bite the lip, as angry wenches will, Nor hast thou pleasure to be cross in talk, But thou with mildness entertain'st thy wooers, With gentle conference, soft and affable. Why does the world report that Kate doth limp? O slanderous world! Kate like the hazel-twig Is straight and slender and as brown in hue As hazel nuts and sweeter than the kernels. O, let me see thee walk: thou dost not halt.
KATHARINA: If I do not, call me gipsy. <variation>
PETRUCHIO: Nay, that's not in my power. <variation>
KATHARINA: If it were, thou wouldst be gipsy-like, perforce. <variation>
PETRUCHIO: I will not be a gipsy, Kate, but a mild gentleman. <variation>
KATHARINA: A witty mother! witless else her son.
PETRUCHIO: Why, how now, Kate? <variation>
KATHARINA: What, coarse and rough and boisterous, and not please? <variation>
PETRUCHIO: I am tame and gentle and as mild as a lamb: <variation>
