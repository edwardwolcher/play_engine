[Together]
W1: I said to him, Give her up—
W2: One Morning as I was sitting—
M: We were not long together—
[End Together.]
W1: I said to him, Give her up. I swore by all I held most sacred—
W2: One Morning as I was sitting— <variation>
M: We were not long together— <variation>
W2: One morning as I was sitting— <variation>
W1: Though I had him dogged for months by a first-rate man, no shadow of proof was forthcoming. And there was no denying that he continued as… assiduous as ever. This, and his horror of the merely Platonic thing, made me sometimes wonder if I were not accusing him unjustly. Yes.
M: We were not long together when she smelled the rat. Give up that whore, she said, or I'll cut my throat—[Hiccup]pardon—so help me God. I knew she could have no proof. So I told— <variation>
W2: One morning as I was sitting— <variation>
M: I told her that I had been forced into closer relations with Mrs. X— <variation>
W1: Judge then of my astonishment when one fine morning, as I was sitting stricken in the morning room, he slunk in, fell on his knees before me, buried his face in my lap and… confessed.
M: She put a bloodhound on me, but I had a little chat with him. He was glad of the extra money.
W2: One morning as I was sitting— <variation>
W1: I confess my first feeling was one of wonderment. What a male!
M: I'm a man of the world. I know what women are. I don't say she wasn't hurt, but I knew she'd come round. <variation>
W2: Anything between us, he said, what do you take me for, a something machine? And of course with him no danger of the… spiritual thing. Then why don't you get out? I said. I sometimes wondered if he was not living with her for her money.
M: He was a gentleman. He was not the sort of man to mention money. <variation>
W1: Then I forgave him. To what will love not stoop! I suggested a little jaunt to celebrate, to the Riviera or our darling Grand Canary. He was looking pale. Peaked. But this was not possible just then. Professional commitments.
W2: Now… I saw him in the hall, stooping before me in— <variation>
M: She saw him in the hall, stooping before her in— <variation>
W1: He swept me off my feet. I was so happy. <variation>
W2: He had been telling her all about it. The plain unvarnished truth. <variation>
W1: My first feeling was one of wonderment. But what a male! <variation>
W2: He went on and on. I could hear a mower. An old hand mower. I stopped him and said that whatever I might feel I had no silly threats to offer—but not much stomach for her leavings either. He thought that over for a bit.
W1: Calves like a flunkey—
M: He ran me through it. I was a fool or a coward. <variation>
W2: That was the only time he touched me. <variation>
W1: I had no intention of leaving. I had no intention of leaving then. <variation>
M: At home all heart to heart, new leaf and bygones bygones. I ran into your ex- doxy, she said one night, on the pillow, you're well out of that. Rather uncalled for, I thought. I am indeed, sweetheart, I said, I am indeed. God what vermin women. Thanks to you, angel, I said.
W1: That was the last time he was mine for good. <variation>
W2: He was mine. Then he began to slip away from me. He began to slip away from me. <variation>
M: I don't know how. I don't know when. But I saw him slip away from me. I saw him slip away from me. <variation>
W1: I saw him slip away from me. <variation>
M: I simply could no longer—
W2: I simply could no longer— <variation>
[Blackout. 5]
[Together.]
W1: I simply could no longer sleep with him. <variation>
W2: I simply could no longer sleep with him. <variation>
M: How could I have known? How could I have known? <variation>
[Blackout. 5]
M: When first this change I actually thanked God. I thought, It is done, it is said, now all is going out—
W1: Not that it matters— <variation>
W2: Not that it matters. <variation>
W1: Not that it matters, perhaps, but my sister, in the end, in the end, in the end— <variation>
M: It is the angels, yes, it is the angels, it is they who are doing this. They are taking me. They are taking me. Oh, the weight of the universe. <variation>
W2: Less confused. Less confusing. At the same time I prefer this to… the other thing. Definitely. There are endurable moments.
M: It is not the angels. It is not the angels. The angels are dancing, singing, it is the angels, it is the angels— <variation>
W2: I heard them singing. <variation>
W1: My sister, my sister. <variation>
M: Peace, yes, I suppose, a kind of peace, and all that pain as if… never been.
W2: Give me up, as a bad job. Go away and start poking and pecking at someone else. On the other hand—
W1: My sister. My sister, my sister. <variation>
M: But, I mean, do you feel the same about me as I feel about you? <variation>
W2: I don't feel anything about you. <variation>
M: Why do you love me? <variation>
W1: Is it that I do not tell the truth, is that it, that some day somehow I may tell the truth at last and then no more light at last, for the truth?
W2: I lie to you, lie to myself, lie to nobody (nobody, nobody) lie to me (me, me) lie to me (me, me) lie to me (me, me) lie to me (me, me) <variation>
M: Tell me the truth. <variation>
W1: I don't want it. <variation>
W2: Mightn't you?
M: What? <variation>
W1: I can do nothing… for anybody… any more… thank God. So it must be something I have to say. How the mind works still!
W2: I believe you, I believe you, I believe you, I believe you, I believe you, I believe you, I believe you, I believe you, I believe you, I believe you, I believe you, I believe you, I believe— <variation>
M: Perhaps they have become friends. Perhaps sorrow—
W1: I haven't got there, not at all. <variation>
M: —is a thing you have to do alone. <variation>
W2: I believe you, I believe you, I believe you, I believe— <variation>
M: Perhaps they meet, and sit, over a cup of that green tea they both so loved, without milk or sugar not even a squeeze of lemon—
W2: And they might even— <variation>
M: —and watch the fireflies— <variation>
W1: Is it something I should do with my face, other than utter? Weep?
W2: Now, there are things I have wondered, but— <variation>
W1: You are an artist, you are an artist. <variation>
M: Meet, and sit, now in the one dear place, now in the other, and sorrow together, and compare—[Hiccup] pardon— happy memories.
W1: If only I could think. There is no sense in this… either, none whatsoever. I can't.
W2: That poor creature who tried to seduce you, what ever became of her, do you suppose?—I can hear her. Poor thing.
M: Personally I always preferred Lipton's.
W1: There are no answers. Only more questions. <variation>
W2: A fine kettle of fish. <variation>
W1: I can't
W2: If only I could think. <variation>
M: I can't, <variation>
W1: I can't, <variation>
M: Pity them.
W2: What do you do when you go out? Shift?
M: Am I hiding something? Have I lost—
W1: A game. <variation>
W2: Like dragging a great roller, on a scorching day. The strain… to get it moving, momentum coming—
[Blackout. 3]
W2: When I came in you were already in bed. <variation>
M: Can't you see I'm sick? <variation>
W2: And you perhaps pitying me, thinking. Poor thing, she needs a rest.
W1: Poor girl. <variation>
M: Why go down? Why not—
W2: Or do you perhaps think it was, she was tired of him? <variation>
W1: Perhaps she is sitting somewhere, by the open window, her hands folded in her lap, gazing down out over the olives—
M: Why not keep on glaring at me without ceasing? I might start to rave and—[Hiccup]—bring it up for you. Par—
W2: You are not bad at all. You are very good. I want you to know I would never have done this if he hadn't. I want you to know I would never have done this if he hadn't deserved it. I didn't do— <variation>
M: —don
W1: —afraid of what you might do. For I know you won't do anything, will you. <variation>
M: —all— <variation>
W2: Am I not perhaps a little unhinged already?
W1: Poor creature. Poor creatures.
M: —a little bit. <variation>
W1: What is to become of you? It's the law of the jungle. It's survival of the fittest. It's a cruel world. What is to become of you? <variation>
W2: That's true. It's true. It's true. It's true. <variation>
M: A little dinghy—
W1: Silence and darkness were all I craved. Well, I get a certain amount of both. They being one. Perhaps it is more wickedness to pray for more.
M: —a little dinghy— <variation>
W1: Perhaps it is. Perhaps it is. Perhaps it is. Perhaps it is. Perhaps it is. Perhaps it is. Perhaps it is. Perhaps it is. Perhaps it is. Perhaps it is. Perhaps it is. Perhaps it is. Perhaps it— <variation>
W2: A shade gone. In the head. Just a shade. I doubt it.
M: The shade of a shade. <variation>
W1: Just a shade. That's all. <variation>
M: I too craved to be in my grave. <variation>
W2: Let me look at you again. <variation>
W1: No. It kills. <variation>
M: And now, that you are… mere eye. Just looking. At my face. On and off.
W1: I can't stand this. I hate it. <variation>
M: Looking for something. In my face. Some truth. In my eyes. Not even.
W2: [Laugh]
M: At your picture in my eyes. You must find all this strange. <variation>
[Blackout. 3]
M: As I much as… being seen?
